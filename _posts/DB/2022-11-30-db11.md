# INTRO 🙌
저번 시간에는 Sorting & Relational Operations 에 대하여 알아보았다.

이번 시간에는 **Evaluation of Relational Operations: Other Techniques**에 대해 알아보자.

****
# Selection Operation (Simple Selection)
- Select (R.attr `<op>` value) R (i.e., $$age = 20$$).

## No index, unsorted (file scan)
- must scan whole table

## No Index, Sorted Data (sorted-file scan)
> 기말 출제 X

$$O(log_2M)+(scan\ cost)$$

- utilize the sort order through a binary search ($$O(log_2M)$$).
    - locate the first tuple that satisfies the selection condition
    - retrieve all tuples that satisfy the selection condition by scanning R until the selection condition is no longer satisfied.
- 한계:
    - 현실에서 정렬된 데이터 보장 X
- 해결:
    - `Alternative (1`):
        - allow data records to be stored as index data entries.
    - If the ordering of data records is important $$\rightarrow$$ B+ tree index that uses `Alternative (1)`.

## B+ Tree Index
- `STEP 1`: locate the first index entry that points to a qualifying tuple of R
    - Cost: 2 or 3 I/Os
- `STEP 2`: Scan the leaf pages to retrieve all entries in which the key value satisfies the selection condition
    - Cost: Depends on the number of qualifying tuples, the employed alternative and whether the index is clustered

기존 index보다 더 좋은 성능의 index 구현 가능하다.
- 기존 index: 파일이 커질수록 많은 **overflow block** 발생 $$\rightarrow$$ 성능 하락 $$\rightarrow$$ 주기적 재구성할 필요
- B+ Tree: 삽입/삭제 시 자동으로 구조 유지 $$\rightarrow$$ 주기적 재구성할 필요 X.

> B+ Tree Index 기말에서 이것만 알면 됨
>
>> Btree: good for $$>=, <=$$

## Hash Index (Best)
- hashing을 통해 데이터 위치 index 저장
    - hashing 함수 = key 값을 일정한 범위의 수로 변환
- Cost = a few (typically one or two) l/Os

> Hash Index 기말에서 이것만 알면 됨
>
>> hash: good for $$=$$

# Projection Operation 🍜
            SELECT DISTINCT R.sid, R.bid
            FROM Reserves R

## 1) Sort-based Projection
An approach based on sorting:
1. Pass 0 (external sort): **eliminate unwanted fields**.  
2. **Eliminate duplicates**.  

0. only need `sid` and `bid`
1. external sorting
2. *Pass 0*: remove unwanted fields (except for `sid` and `bid`).
3. if duplicates in merging $$\rightarrow$$ discard them

## 2) Hash-based Projection
0. only need `sid` and `bid`
1. external sorting
2. $$h1()$$: generate $$B-1$$ partitions (each partition = small enough to fit in memory)
3. remove unwatned fields
4. $$h2\ (<>\ h1)$$ (if partition is still too big $$\rightarrow$$ go to 2 (recursive)).
5. remove duplicates in each partition (duplicates already in the hash table); 서로 다른 partition 간 duplicate 존재 X (hashing 거쳤기 때문)
6. write out all tuples in the hash table $$\rightarrow$$ no duplicates

> **Purpose of Hash table** : keep track of which tuple is on focus

# Set Operations 🍘
## Intersection and cross-product
- Special cases of join.

## Union (Distinct) and Except
- **Union** $$\Leftrightarrow$$ Except.
- removes duplicates within the same partition
    - put in memory (hash table)
    - if already exist $$\rightarrow$$ duplicates.

### Sorting based approach to union:
            SELECT DISTINCT R.sid, R.bid
            FROM Reserves R

- Sort both relations (on combination of all attributes).
- Scan sorted relations and merge them.
- *Alternative*:  Merge runs from Pass 0 for both relations.

### Hash based approach to union:
- Partition $$R$$ and $$S$$ using hash function $$h()$$.
- For each S-partition:
    - build in-memory hash table (using h2)
    - scan corresponding R-partition
    - add tuples to table while discarding duplicates.

# Aggregate Operations (AVG, MIN, etc.) 🥚
- Expensive!! ($$\larr$$ must touch all tuples)

> **index-only scan**:
>
>> SELECT 칼럼 및 WHERE 조건을 모두 포함하는 인덱스 기준 scan; avoid looking at the table data entirely

## Without grouping:
        SELECT max(sal)
        FROM Emp

- In general, **requires scanning the whole relation**.
- Given index whose search key includes all attributes in the $$SELECT$$ or $$WHERE$$ clauses, can do **index-only scan**.

## With grouping:
        SELECT max(sal), qty
        FROM Emp
        GROUP BY qty

- **Sort on group-by attributes**, then scan relation and compute aggregate for each group.
    - Can improve upon this by combining sorting and aggregate computation
        - Sorting 과정에서 *mean* 같은 수치 구할 수 있음.
- Similar approach based on **hashing on group-by attributes**.
- Given **tree index** whose search key includes all attributes in $$SELECT$$, $$WHERE$$ and $$GROUP\ BY$$ clauses, can do **index-only scan**
    - if group-by attributes form prefix of search key, can retrieve data entries/tuples in group-by order.

# Summary 👌
- A virtue of relational DBMSs:
    - **queries are composed of a few basic operators**; the implementation of these operators can be carefully tuned (and it is important to do this!).
- Many alternative implementation techniques for each operator
    - no universally superior technique for most operators.  
- Must consider available alternatives for each operation in a query and choose best one based on system statistics, etc.
    - This is part of the broader task of optimizing a query composed of several ops.
