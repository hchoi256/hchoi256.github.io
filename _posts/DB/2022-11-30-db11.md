# INTRO 🙌
저번 시간에는 Sorting & Relational Operations 에 대하여 알아보았다.

이번 시간에는 **Evaluation of Relational Operations: Other Techniques**에 대해 알아보자.

# Evaluation of Relational Operations: Other Techniques 💜
$$Sorting\ vs\ Hashing$$

## Simple Selections
- Select (R.attr op value) R

$$age = 20$$
$$attr = age$$
$$op = '='$$
$$20 = value$$

- **No index, unsorted** $$\rarr$$ must scan whole table
- With an index on selection attribute: use it (i.e., $$age$$)

> hash: good for $$=$$
> Btree: good for $$>=, <=$$

## Projection Operation
        SELECT   DISTINCT
                    R.sid, R.bid
        FROM     Reserves R

### Sort-based projection
An approach based on sorting:
- Modify Pass 0 of external sort to eliminate unwanted fields.  
- Modify merging passes to eliminate duplicates.  

0. only need $$sid$$ and $$bid$$
1. external sorting
2. *Pass 0*: remove unwanted fields (except for $$sid$$ and $$bid$$)
2-1. if duplicates in merging $$\rarr$$ ignore it

### Hash-based Projection
**Partitioning phase**: Read $$R$$ using one input buffer. For each tuple, discard unwanted fields, apply hash function $$h1$$ to choose one of $$B-1$$ output buffers.
- Result is $$B-1$$ partitions (of tuples with no unwanted fields). 2 tuples from different partitions guaranteed to be distinct.

**Duplicate elimination phase**: For each partition, read it and build an in-memory hash table, using hash fn $$h2 (<> h1)$$ on all fields, while discarding duplicates. 
- If partition does not fit in memory, can apply hash-based projection algorithm recursively to this partition.

0. only need $$sid$$ and $$bid$$
1. external sorting
2. partitioning (each partition = small enough to fit in memory)
3. remove unwatned fields
4. hashing (if partition is still too big $$\rarr$$ go to 2 (recursive))
5. remove duplicates in each partition (duplicates already in the hash table)
6. write out all tuples in the hash table $$\rarr$$ no duplicates

> **Purpose of Hash table** : keep track of which tuple is on focus

## Set Operations
### Intersection and cross-product
Special cases of join.

### Union (Distinct) and Except
Similar; we’ll do **Union**.
- removes duplicates within the same partition
    - put in memory (hash table)
    - if already exist $$\rarr$$ duplicates

#### Sorting based approach to union:
- Sort both relations (on combination of all attributes).
- Scan sorted relations and merge them.
- Alternative:  Merge runs from Pass 0 for both relations.

#### Hash based approach to union:
- Partition $$R$$ and $$S$$ using hash function $$h$$.
- For each S-partition, build in-memory hash table (using h2), scan corr. R-partition and add tuples to table while discarding duplicates.

> 기말출제!! ★★★★★★
>
> Sort-based intersection to union $$\rarr$$ hash-based intersection to union

## Aggregate Operations (AVG, MIN, etc.)
- Expensive!! ($$\larr$$ must touch all tuples)

> **index-only scan**: the data comes directly from the index and the visibility check is handled specially, so it can avoid looking at the table data entirely.

### Without grouping:
        SELECT max(sal)
        FROM Emp

- In general, **requires scanning the relation**.
- Given index whose search key includes all attributes in the $$SELECT$$ or $$WHERE$$ clauses, can do **index-only scan**.

### With grouping:
        SELECT max(sal), qty
        FROM Emp
        GROUP BY qty

- **Sort on group-by attributes**, then scan relation and compute aggregate for each group. 
    - Can improve upon this by combining sorting and aggregate computation
        - Sorting 과정에서 *mean* 같은 수치 구할 수 있음.
- Similar approach based on **hashing on group-by attributes**.
- Given **tree index** whose search key includes all attributes in $$SELECT$$, $$WHERE$$ and $$GROUP\ BY$$ clauses, can do **index-only scan**
    - if group-by attributes form prefix of search key, can retrieve data entries/tuples in group-by order.

****
# Summary 👌
- A virtue of relational DBMSs: **queries are composed of a few basic operators**; the implementation of these operators can be carefully tuned (and it is important to do this!).
- Many alternative implementation techniques for each operator; no universally superior technique for most operators.  
- Must consider available alternatives for each operation in a query and choose best one based on system statistics, etc.  This is part of the broader task of optimizing a query composed of several ops.
