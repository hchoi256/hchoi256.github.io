# 한줄요약 ✔
- The objective of classification training is not entirely consistent with that of localization.
    - Very low entropy might be important for classification, but less helpful for localization.
- Sweet spot for localization with respect to entropy.
    - new term to the loss function.
        - predicted class prob. vector가 uniform dist.에 닮게 만드는 정도를 조절 → uniform dist.는 각 클래스 예측 확률이 동일 (class 예측 불확실성 증가) → localization 성능 증가.
